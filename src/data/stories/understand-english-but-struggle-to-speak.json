  "text": "Many English learners can follow movies, podcasts, or meetings but struggle to speak quickly. This gap matters because it is not a sign of “not knowing English.” It usually comes from how the brain stores and retrieves language, and it can be improved with specific practice.\n\nUnderstanding is often easier than speaking because comprehension uses recognition, while speaking requires recall. When you listen or read, you can recognize words even if they are weakly learned, and context fills in missing pieces. When you speak, you must choose a word, its grammar, and its pronunciation fast, with no multiple-choice options. Psycholinguistic research describes this as a difference between receptive vocabulary (words you understand) and productive vocabulary (words you can use).\n\nWord-finding problems often happen during lexical retrieval, the step where the brain selects a word from many competitors. In models of speech production developed by Willem Levelt and others, speakers move from a message idea to a word form and then to sounds. If retrieval is slow, you may pause, use a simpler word, or switch to your first language. This is common in a second language because links between meaning and the English word are less automatic, so competing words interfere more.\n\nProcessing speed is another reason. Skilled speakers do not just “know more”; they access what they know quickly. In conversation, you have to plan content while listening and watching the other person, which uses working memory. Research in cognitive psychology shows that working memory has limited capacity, and stress can reduce performance. If you worry about mistakes, attention shifts from meaning to monitoring grammar, which slows speech and increases tip-of-the-tongue moments.\n\nInput can also be unbalanced. Many learners get large amounts of listening and reading but little speaking, so the brain becomes efficient at comprehension but not at production. Usage-based theories of language learning, associated with researchers like Michael Tomasello, emphasize that fluency grows from repeated use in real contexts. Without repeated speaking, you may “know” a word but never build a fast route to it. This is why you can recognize advanced vocabulary in articles but still rely on basic words in conversation.\n\nAnother cause is knowing a word but not knowing its typical partners, called collocations. English speakers say “make a decision,” “heavy rain,” and “take responsibility.” If you know “decision” but not the verb that usually goes with it, you hesitate because several verbs seem possible. Corpus linguistics, which studies large databases of real language, shows that common collocations strongly shape natural speech. Learning words together, not alone, reduces retrieval time.\n\nPractical improvement comes from training recall, not more passive exposure. Timed speaking tasks help because they force retrieval under pressure, closer to real conversation. Short daily practice works well: describe your day for two minutes, retell a news story, or answer common interview questions aloud. Also practice “retrieval with feedback”: record yourself, notice missing words, then repeat the same message with better wording. This kind of deliberate repetition builds automaticity.\n\nIt also helps to prepare “chunks,” ready-made phrases that fit many situations, such as “What I mean is…,” “The main reason is…,” and “I’m not sure about the exact number, but…”. These chunks reduce planning load and give you time to retrieve harder words. In addition, spaced repetition with active recall, such as using flashcards where you produce the word from a definition or example, strengthens productive vocabulary more than rereading lists.\n\nUnderstanding without easy speaking is a normal stage, not a personal failure. In school, work, and immigration settings, speaking ability affects opportunities, so closing the gap has real consequences. When you focus on fast retrieval, collocations, and repeated spoken practice, your productive vocabulary catches up to your receptive vocabulary, and conversation becomes less exhausting and more accurate.",
