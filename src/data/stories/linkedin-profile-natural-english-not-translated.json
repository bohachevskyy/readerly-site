  "text": "A LinkedIn profile sounds natural in English when it uses clear role nouns, direct verbs, and specific proof, not word-for-word translations from another language. This matters because recruiters often scan profiles for 10–30 seconds, and the first lines of your headline and About section decide whether they keep reading.\n\nThe first place translation shows is the headline, because many learners translate a job title plus a long description. In English, a strong headline usually contains your role, your specialty, and one concrete focus. “Engineer with experience in many areas” is vague, while “Mechanical Engineer | HVAC design | Energy efficiency” tells the reader what you do. Avoid empty intensifiers such as “hard-working,” “responsible,” or “dynamic,” because they do not separate you from others. Replace them with information that can be checked, such as tools (Python, SolidWorks), domains (fintech, supply chain), or outcomes (cost reduction, safety compliance). This matters because LinkedIn search also relies on keywords, and clear terms help you appear in the right searches.\n\nThe About section becomes more natural when you write in a simple first-person professional voice, with short sentences and strong verbs. A common translated pattern is “I have the honor to…” or “I am passionate about everything related to…”. In English business writing, these sound formal or unfocused. Use verbs like “build,” “analyze,” “design,” “lead,” “ship,” “improve,” and add the object: “I analyze customer data to reduce churn” is clearer than “I am responsible for analysis.” Also avoid long sentences with many commas, which often come from direct translation. Break them into two sentences, and keep the subject clear. This matters because clarity increases trust: readers feel they understand your work quickly.\n\nSpecific evidence is what makes your English sound original rather than copied. Many translated profiles describe duties but not results, using phrases like “in charge of” or “responsible for.” Instead, add measurable outcomes and scope: team size, budget size, number of users, or time saved. If you cannot share confidential numbers, you can still be concrete: “reduced manual reporting time by automating weekly dashboards” or “supported audits under ISO 9001 procedures.” Mention recognizable methods or standards only if you used them in real work. This matters because English-language hiring culture often treats outcomes as the strongest signal of competence.\n\nYour Experience bullets (and also your project descriptions) sound natural when they start with a past-tense action verb and avoid heavy noun phrases. Translated text often becomes a chain of nouns, like “implementation of the optimization of the process of…” In English, turn nouns back into verbs: “optimized the process” or “implemented a faster review workflow.” Another translation issue is overusing “the” and “of,” which makes sentences slow. “Built onboarding materials for new analysts” reads cleaner than “Built the materials of onboarding for the new analysts.” This matters because simple grammar reduces cognitive load and keeps attention on your achievements.\n\nWord choice and tone are where “translated English” is easiest to notice. Avoid false friends and overly formal phrases common in templates: “Dear network,” “kindly,” “esteemed,” “with great interest,” or “I am open to any opportunity.” English LinkedIn writing is polite but straightforward. Say what you want: “I’m open to data analyst roles in Berlin” or “I’m interested in backend engineering positions focused on distributed systems.” Use “I” when describing your work; using “we” for everything can hide your contribution, but using “I” for team results can sound inaccurate. A balanced approach is: “Led X” for your leadership and “Worked with a cross-functional team to Y” for shared outcomes. This matters because the right tone signals confidence without sounding aggressive.\n\nFinally, make your profile read like your real speaking voice by revising for rhythm and checking it with reading aloud. If a sentence feels hard to say, it often reads like translation. Keep a small set of repeatable phrases that are normal in English: “I work on…,” “I help…,” “My focus is…,” “Recently, I…,” “I’m looking for…”. Ask one fluent speaker to mark sentences that feel unnatural, then replace them with simpler structures, not more complex vocabulary. This matters because natural English is not about advanced words; it is about predictable patterns that readers recognize immediately.\n\nLinkedIn profiles increasingly get read by both humans and automated systems, so natural English and clear keywords work together. When you use direct verbs, concrete proof, and a clean structure, your profile stops sounding translated and starts sounding like a professional document written for an English-speaking audience today.",
