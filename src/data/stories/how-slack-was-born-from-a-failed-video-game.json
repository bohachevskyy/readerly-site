Read the story of Slack's unlikely pivot and practice English vocabulary with instant word translations.", "level": "B1", "appUrl": "https://app.readerly.ai?utm_source=blog&utm_medium=word-banner&utm_campaign=how-slack-was-born-from-a-failed-video-game", "text": "Slack became a major workplace messaging platform because its creators stopped building an online game and rebuilt their internal communication tool as a product. This matters in startup history because it shows a repeatable pattern: a team can salvage real value from a failed project when it notices which internal system solves a wider, painful problem for many companies.\n\nThe story starts with Tiny Speck, a startup co-founded by Stewart Butterfield, who had already built Flickr before Yahoo bought it in 2005. Tiny Speck raised venture funding and spent years building Glitch, a multiplayer online game designed to run in a web browser. Glitch launched to the public in 2011, but it struggled to keep enough players to support the business. In November 2012, Tiny Speck announced it would shut the game down, and Glitch closed in December 2012. The failure was not only about game design; it was also about the economics of keeping a live online world running when user growth is too slow.\n\nDuring Glitch’s development, the team needed a fast way to coordinate work across programmers, artists, and operations staff. Email threads and scattered files were too slow, especially when decisions changed many times per day. Tiny Speck built an internal chat system that combined real-time messaging with searchable history, so people could find past decisions instead of asking again. They also connected the tool to software services the team already used, so updates from code repositories and automated systems could appear directly in the conversation. In practice, the tool acted as a shared “work log” that stayed usable months later because it could be searched.\n\nAfter deciding to close Glitch, Butterfield and his colleagues looked for assets worth keeping. The internal chat tool stood out because it solved a problem almost every modern team has: coordination among many people working on different tasks at the same time. Many companies were already using products like IRC, email, and early group chat tools, but these systems often failed at two crucial needs: keeping knowledge easy to retrieve and connecting conversation to the tools where work actually happens. Tiny Speck turned the internal tool into a new product, renamed the company Slack Technologies, and focused on making it reliable for organizations rather than just for one game studio.\n\nSlack’s early product decisions matched what real workplaces demanded. It kept conversations in “channels” so teams could separate topics, and it made direct messages available for private coordination. It emphasized search and message history, which changed chat from something temporary into something closer to a living archive. It also offered integrations, meaning other software could send notifications into Slack or be controlled from Slack. This mattered because work software is rarely one program; teams use many systems at once, and the value of a communication tool rises when it reduces switching between them.\n\nSlack launched publicly in 2013 and gained attention quickly in the technology community, especially among software teams that already understood the pain of fragmented communication. By February 2014, Slack announced that it had reached 1 million daily active users, a concrete sign that it was spreading beyond a small niche. Growth came from a bottom-up adoption pattern: small teams could start using Slack without waiting for a long corporate purchasing process, then usage could expand as more coworkers joined. That adoption style fit the product, because the usefulness of a shared channel increases as more of the relevant team participates.\n\nSlack also emerged at a time when cloud-based business software was becoming normal. Companies were more willing to use a web service for internal work, and employees expected real-time tools similar to consumer messaging apps. Slack’s focus on usability made it feel less like old enterprise software and more like a modern communication product, but the real differentiator was that it treated workplace communication as data that should be searchable, organized, and connected to daily tools.\n\nThe broader implication is that “failure” in a startup can still produce a valuable platform if the team pays attention to what worked internally and can generalize it to a market. Slack’s origin inside Glitch demonstrates a disciplined kind of pivot: it was based on observed daily use, not on abstract ideas. Today, the same lesson influences how founders evaluate side tools, internal dashboards, and automation scripts, because one of them can reveal the real product their users need.", "words": {"0":
