  "text": "On a foggy morning in April 1775, farmers and shopkeepers in Massachusetts began doing something that would have sounded impossible a decade earlier: they prepared to fight the British Army.\n\nThe trouble had been building for years. After the Seven Years’ War, Britain wanted the American colonies to help pay the empire’s debts. London passed new taxes and trade rules, and many colonists argued that Parliament had no right to tax them because they had no elected representatives there. The slogan “no taxation without representation” spread through newspapers, speeches, and tavern talk.\n\nBy the early 1770s, the conflict was not only about money. It was about power. Britain sent troops to Boston. Colonial resistance grew. The Boston Tea Party in December 1773—when protesters dumped East India Company tea into the harbor—led Britain to pass harsh measures that the colonists called the “Intolerable Acts.” In response, colonists organized more tightly, forming networks of local committees and training part-time soldiers known as militia.\n\nIn Massachusetts, one fear dominated: that British authorities would seize colonial weapons and arrest rebel leaders. So the militia began storing gunpowder, muskets, and cannon in different towns. Concord, about 20 miles northwest of Boston, was one of those storage places.\n\nOn the night of April 18, 1775, British troops set out from Boston under orders to march to Concord. Their mission was to destroy military supplies. They also hoped to capture two well-known Patriot leaders, Samuel Adams and John Hancock, who were staying in Lexington.\n\nThe countryside did not stay quiet for long. Riders were sent out to warn people that British troops were moving. Paul Revere became the most famous of these messengers, partly because of later stories and poems, but he was not alone. William Dawes rode a different route, and others—some of them local riders whose names are less remembered—helped spread the alarm.\n\nJust before dawn on April 19, the first confrontation happened in Lexington. A small group of militia, sometimes called “minutemen,” stood on the town green. They did not expect to defeat the British. They likely wanted to show presence and protect their community. British soldiers arrived, tense and impatient. In the confusion, a shot was fired—no one is completely sure by whom. It became known later as “the shot heard ’round the world.”\n\nThe skirmish in Lexington was brief but deadly. Several colonists were killed. The British continued on to Concord.\n\nAt Concord, the situation changed. Militia from nearby towns gathered in larger numbers. At the North Bridge, fighting broke out again. This time the militia forced British troops to retreat. It was a small battle in size, but it mattered psychologically: local citizens had pushed back trained soldiers.\n\nThe return march to Boston turned into a running fight. As British troops moved along narrow roads, militia fired from behind trees, stone walls, and buildings. The geography favored the locals, who knew the land and could move in and out quickly. By the time the exhausted British column reached safety near Boston, both sides had taken significant casualties.\n\nNews traveled fast. Within days, militia from many colonies began moving toward Massachusetts. Boston was soon surrounded in a siege. Two months later, in June 1775, the Battle of Bunker Hill showed that the conflict was not going to disappear. Even though the British ultimately took the hill, their heavy losses shocked leaders in London and encouraged the Patriots.\n\nLexington and Concord are often described as the start of the American Revolutionary War, but the deeper story is about escalation. Arguments that began as political complaints turned into armed conflict when both sides believed they were defending basic rights and authority. Britain saw rebellion and disorder. The Patriots saw a government acting without consent.\n\nFor adult English learners, this event is also a good reminder about how history is preserved: we know about these hours through letters, depositions, official reports, and local memories—sources that sometimes disagree. That disagreement is not a weakness. It’s a clue. It shows how confusing real events can be, especially when fear, noise, and fast decisions control the moment.\n\nOn April 19, 1775, the road between Lexington and Concord became more than a road. It became a line people crossed—from protest to war.",
