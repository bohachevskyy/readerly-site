Those same facts now shape how Peru protects the ruins and controls modern tourism. Understanding the link between geography, engineering, and management explains why visiting Machu Picchu requires strict rules and careful planning.\n\nMachu Picchu lies on a narrow mountain ridge above the Urubamba River in southern Peru, about 2,430 meters above sea level. The closest large city is Cusco, the former Inca capital. The location is dramatic but difficult: cliffs limit easy access, and the region has a wet season with intense rainfall and a dry season with dust and strong sun. This remoteness helped the site avoid the kind of stone-robbing and rebuilding that happened to many Inca centers near towns and roads after the Spanish conquest of the Inca Empire in the 1530s.\n\nThe site is usually linked to Inca emperor Pachacuti, who ruled in the 15th century, and most archaeologists date major construction to around 1450. When Spanish forces and their allies entered the Cusco region, they did not record Machu Picchu as a city they occupied. That absence from colonial documents matters because it suggests the site was not integrated into the new colonial system of roads, taxes, and forced labor that transformed many Andean settlements. The result is that many walls, terraces, and building foundations remained where Inca engineers placed them.\n\nInca engineering also protected Machu Picchu from its own environment. Builders used precisely cut stone blocks in many elite structures, often without mortar, so walls could flex slightly during earthquakes instead of cracking apart. Even more important is what lies under the visible ruins. The site is built on steep, unstable terrain, so Inca planners created a deep system of foundations, drainage layers, and channels to move water away from buildings and plazas. Terraces were not only for agriculture; they acted as retaining walls that stabilized slopes and slowed erosion during storms.\n\nWater management shows how technical the design was. Machu Picchu has stone canals and fountains fed by a spring, and these features required steady gradients so water flowed without destroying the channels. At the same time, surface drainage reduced puddling that can weaken soil. Without these systems, repeated wet-season rains would push soil downhill and undermine walls. The engineering explains why parts of the site remain intact despite centuries of exposure.\n\nModern preservation began after Machu Picchu became widely known internationally in the early 20th century. In 1983, UNESCO inscribed the Historic Sanctuary of Machu Picchu as a World Heritage Site, recognizing both cultural remains and the surrounding mountain ecosystem. That status increased global attention and tourism, which created a new problem: foot traffic can wear down stone steps, loosen soils on narrow paths, and increase pressure on fragile terraces.\n\nVisitor management in Peru is therefore built around controlling movement and time. The main access is from the town of Aguas Calientes (also called Machu Picchu Pueblo) by bus up a steep road, or by multi-day trekking routes such as the Inca Trail, which ends at the Sun Gate. Authorities limit daily entries and require timed tickets and regulated circuits so crowds do not cluster in the same corridors. Guides are often required or strongly encouraged because trained supervision reduces off-trail walking, touching of masonry, and risky behavior near edges.\n\nThe remote location still shapes policy. Because almost all supplies must come through limited transport routes, waste management and emergency response are harder than at urban monuments. Heavy rain can trigger landslides and temporarily close trails or roads, and this risk increases when soils are disturbed. For that reason, Peru’s protection strategy relies on preventive control: keeping people on designed routes, monitoring slopes and drainage, and reducing impacts before they become structural damage.\n\nMachu Picchu matters today as a test case for sustainable tourism at a world-famous site. Its survival was not an accident; it was produced by isolation and by engineering that respected local geology and water. Modern rules extend that same logic: the mountain setting cannot be changed, so visitors must adapt to the limits of the place. When management succeeds, the site remains both a cultural record of Inca state power and a living landscape that can endure for future generations.", "words": {"0": {"word": "Machu Picchu", "pos":
