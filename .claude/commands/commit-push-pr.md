description: Commit changes and make a new pr to main

If current branch is main, create a new branch. Make a short name best at your abilities

Add all files to changes `git add .` and commit it.

Using your context to understand the changes made create a PR. Make the pr description short and pragmatic. Do NOT include a checkboxes and testing plan. Only description of the changes.

Act like a pragmatic engineer.
